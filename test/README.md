# Hikingmap testsuite

To improve quality a number of test tracks are included here, which produced or are still producing errors. Please refer to the issues on github for more information on the error of a specific test track.

Cram is used for testing, make sure the tests pass before creating a pull request.

## Creating issues

Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/roelderickx/hikingmap/issues) if you stumble upon a track which is not processed well by hikingmap. The gpx track is needed to be able to reproduce the error, but to avoid copyright infringements run `anongpx.py inputfile.gpx outputfile.gpx` first to anonimize the data.
